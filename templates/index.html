        <p class="modal-text">You have found your way to the Promptiverse, a gallery site to showcase AI art.</p>
        <p class="modal-text">AI art is a form of art created using artificial intelligence algorithms.
          These algorithms are designed to learn patterns from existing data and generate new, unique outputs that can
          be considered art.
          The AI system can be trained on a variety of input sources, such as images, text, and audio.</p>

        <p class="modal-text">The process of creating AI art involves feeding the AI system with input data and letting
          it generate a new output based on the learned patterns.
          The generated output can then be refined or altered by a human artist to create a final piece of art.</p>
